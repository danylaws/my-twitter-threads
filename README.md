# my-twitter-threads 🧵

I've published several twitter threads since the beginning of the year. As they become less visible over time, The goal here is to gather them, and to make the easily reachable. They are mostly about **C#** and **AWS**.

Feel free to make suggestions, I am open to any advice! You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/danylaws) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/danylaws).

##### Enjoy! 😉👍
